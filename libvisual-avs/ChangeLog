2010-02-02  Scott Sibley <scott@starlon.net>

	* plguins/actor/*: More plugin templates. Just the basics for now.

2010-02-01  Scott Sibley <scott@starlon.net>

	* plugins/transform/*: Ported more plugins. Again, no testing done. No
	build scripts. No voodoo. Just params, copy/paste, and privatizing.
	* common/avs_globals.*: Added AvsLPVOID for two trans plugins.

2010-01-31  Scott Sibley <scott@starlon.net>

	* plugins/actor/superscope/: Superscope now handles colors, although only
	32 bit.
	* plugins/transform/*: Ported several plugins. No testing was done, and
	they're likely incomplete. I more less did params and some copy/paste work.
	* visscript/avs_runnable.c: Inject $PI, $E, and $PHI into every variable
	manager.

2010-01-27  Scott Sibley <scott@starlon.net>

	* plugins/transform/movement/: Updated to current code. It's buggy at the
	moment.
	* plugins/*: Included copies of all avs source into their respective
	directories.

2010-01-26  Scott Sibley <scott@starlon.net>

	* visscript/avs.h, visscript/avs_debug.h, visscript/avs_compile.c:
	Improved VisScript debugging. It will now follow libvisual's verbosness.
	Check avs.h for additional debug macros. Also I modified dump_stack so 
	it now uses the debug facility instead of writing directly to stdout.

2010-01-25  Scott Sibley <scott@starlon.net>

	* plugins/*: Remove VisString code
	* visscript/*: Provide getosc and getspec with a VisAudio
	* visscript/avs_functions.c: Cache getosc/getspec results
	* common/avs_globals.*: Added GlobalProxy for pipeline globals -- the
	proxy is set as the plugin's private object from within the pipeline.
	Extract it before assigning the plugin's real private object, if desired.
	Handle the proxy as you would any other VisObject.
	* plugins/transform/dmovement/*: More attempts to get this working
