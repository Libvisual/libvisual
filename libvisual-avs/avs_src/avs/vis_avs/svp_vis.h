// Note! 
// *Video points to memory in 32bit video memory, ie, the following can be used
// for your utility and to help your understanding of the pixel format used.

// In Visual C, you should start a DLL project, under code generation set it to
// use the DLL libraries, and most likely for release you will want to turn
// optimisation for speed on. Include this .h file in your project, then create
// or add your main C/C++ file and #include "vis.h"

// To start off, fill in the VisInfo structure. Render should draw a whole frame
// into the 32 bit ABGR buffer (for blur, smoke and zoom to work it should, rather
// than replacing the video data, add to it using bitwise or, saturated add, or
// alpha blend). Make sure not to exceed the boundaries given. 'Pitch' specifies
// the distance, in pixels, between the start of each line. If you have a pointer
// at the start of a line, Pointer+Pitch is the start of the next line and
// Pointer-Pitch is the start of the previous.
// Make sure that QueryModule is defined exactly as at the end of this file,
// including the extern "C" keyword if you're using C++. It should return a
// pointer to this structure. All routines that are pointed to by the structure
// must be filled in even if they don't do anything. Render is the only function
// that is required to have a body.
