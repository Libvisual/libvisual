This plugin is a rough port from the xmms nebulus and it needs A LOT of
maintaince.

TODO:
	* implement nebulus_calc_fps(). (Now always returns 40) 
	* Throw everything in privates.
	* Make a more  general framework for effects and look into fading
	  between effects.
	* Make the current effects react better on sound.
	* Make a system to load libvisual actors in a texture.
	* CLEANUPS CLEANUPS CLEANUPS MAINTAINCE *eh*.
	* Port over some nice http://rss-glx.sourceforge.net/ screensavers
	  into cool audio visualisation effects.
	* openGL detection never fails, eh !? buildtree issue.
	* When the super the duper kickass libvisual audio core lands
	  use it's bpm detection instead of the included one.

I really can use some help here. I can't maintain all the plugins i port to
libvisual, it's simply a load and besides i want to put my time into
libvisual.

The reason i port these babies is to provide a start, and to make sure
the platform .1 is tested .2 has something to show off
