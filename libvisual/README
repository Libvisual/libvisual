Libvisual
=========

What's Libvisual?
------------------

Libvisual is a library that acts as a middle layer between
applications that want audio visualisation, and audio visualisation
plugins. It is aimed at providing a common interface between
application developers with a need for audio visualisation and
developers who write visualisations.

Why Libvisual?
--------------

As an application developer, Libvisual provides you an easy way to do
audio visualisation. Using Libvisual gets you easy access to all the
visualisations that are written for Libvisual.

As a plugin writer, Libvisual provides a nice host for your plugin.
It runs analysis over the audio input usage and handles everything
necessary for display in any Libvisual-using application.

Software Requirements
---------------------

C/C++20 compiler

    Libvisual uses several C11 and C++20 features for its modern API
    design and implementation, and as such, requires an up-to-date
    C/C++ compiler to build. Compilers tested and known to work are
    GCC 11+ and Clang 14+.

Libraries

    The core library is fairly self-contained and requires almost very
    little dependencies other than the standard C99 and C++11 libraries.

    The Oil Runtime Compiler (https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/projects/orc.html)
    (ORC) is required for generating a portion of Libvisual's SIMD routines.

    GNU Gettext is optionally required (see note) for
    internationalisation.

    The bundled examples, benchmarks and test programs mostly require
    SDL 1.2 (https://www.libsdl.org).

    ** Note: Gettext is integrated into glibc on Linux.

Compiling and installing
------------------------

Configuration

    Building Libvisual requires CMake 3.20 (https://www.cmake.org) or
    above. The command to configure the build is:

        cmake .

    To set a installation prefix, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>` to
    the commandline.

    CMake comes with a wizard mode that hand holds you through the entire
    process, prompting you for each configurable option. To use it, run:

        cmake -i .

    Alternatively, CMake has a neat GUI that can be run with:

        cmake-gui .

Building

    Once configuration is complete, run Make to begin the compiling.

        make

Installing

    After compilation is finished, install the built library with:

        make install
